v</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is thought that a selection from
Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s early verses may be of interest to a large
public at present familiar only with the always popular <i>Ballad
of Reading Gaol</i>, also included in this volume.&nbsp; The
poems were first collected by their author when he was twenty-sex
years old, and though never, until recently, well received by the
critics, have survived the test of <span
class="GutSmall">NINE</span> editions.&nbsp; Readers will be able
to make for themselves the obvious and striking contrasts <a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>between these
first and last phases of Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s literary
activity.&nbsp; The intervening period was devoted almost
entirely to dramas, prose, fiction, essays, and criticism.</p>

ix</span>NOTE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the end of the complete text
will be found a shorter version based on the original draft of
the poem.&nbsp; This is included for the benefit of reciters and
their audiences who have found the entire poem too long for
declamation.&nbsp; I have tried to obviate a difficulty, without
officiously exercising the ungrateful prerogatives of a literary
executor, by falling back on a text which represents the
author&rsquo;s first scheme for a poem&mdash;never intended of
course for recitation.</p>

BALLAD OF READING GAOL</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">I</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">He</span> did not wear his
scarlet coat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For blood and wine are red,<br />
And blood and wine were on his hands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When they found him with the dead,<br />
The poor dead woman whom he loved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And murdered in her bed.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>He walked amongst the Trial Men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a suit of shabby grey;<br />
A cricket cap was on his head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his step seemed light and gay;<br />
But I never saw a man who looked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So wistfully at the day.</p>
<p class="poetry">I never saw a man who looked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With such a wistful eye<br />
Upon that little tent of blue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which prisoners call the sky,<br />
And at every drifting cloud that went<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With sails of silver by.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>I walked, with other souls in pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within another ring,<br />
And was wondering if the man had done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A great or little thing,<br />
When a voice behind me whispered low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>That fellow&rsquo;s got to
swing</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Dear Christ! the very prison walls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly seemed to reel,<br />
And the sky above my head became<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a casque of scorching steel;<br />
And, though I was a soul in pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My pain I could not feel.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>I only knew what hunted thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickened his step, and why<br />
He looked upon the garish day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With such a wistful eye;<br />
The man had killed the thing he loved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so he had to die.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet each man kills the thing he loves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By each let this be heard,<br />
Some do it with a bitter look,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some with a flattering word,<br />
The coward does it with a kiss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The brave man with a sword!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>Some kill their love when they are young,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And some when they are old;<br />
Some strangle with the hands of Lust,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some with the hands of Gold:<br />
The kindest use a knife, because<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dead so soon grow cold.</p>
<p class="poetry">Some love too little, some too long,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some sell, and others buy;<br />
Some do the deed with many tears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And some without a sigh:<br />
For each man kills the thing he loves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet each man does not die.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>He does not die a death of shame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On a day of dark disgrace,<br />
Nor have a noose about his neck,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor a cloth upon his face,<br />
Nor drop feet foremost through the floor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into an empty space.</p>
<p class="poetry">He does not sit with silent men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who watch him night and day;<br />
Who watch him when he tries to weep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And when he tries to pray;<br />
Who watch him lest himself should rob<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The prison of its prey.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>He does not wake at dawn to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dread figures throng his room,<br />
The shivering Chaplain robed in white,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sheriff stern with gloom,<br />
And the Governor all in shiny black,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the yellow face of Doom.</p>
<p class="poetry">He does not rise in piteous haste<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To put on convict-clothes,<br />
While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each new and nerve-twitched pose,<br />
Fingering a watch whose little ticks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are like horrible hammer-blows.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>He does not know that sickening thirst<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That sands one&rsquo;s throat, before<br />
The hangman with his gardener&rsquo;s gloves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Slips through the padded door,<br />
And binds one with three leathern thongs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the throat may thirst no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">He does not bend his head to hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Burial Office read,<br />
Nor, while the terror of his soul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tells him he is not dead,<br />
Cross his own coffin, as he moves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the hideous shed.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>He does not stare upon the air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through a little roof of glass:<br />
He does not pray with lips of clay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For his agony to pass;<br />
Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The kiss of Caiaphas.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>II</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Six</span> weeks our
guardsman walked the yard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the suit of shabby grey:<br />
His cricket cap was on his head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his step seemed light and gay,<br />
But I never saw a man who looked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So wistfully at the day.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>I never saw a man who looked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With such a wistful eye<br />
Upon that little tent of blue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which prisoners call the sky,<br />
And at every wandering cloud that trailed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its ravelled fleeces by.</p>
<p class="poetry">He did not wring his hands, as do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those witless men who dare<br />
To try to rear the changeling Hope<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the cave of black Despair:<br />
He only looked upon the sun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And drank the morning air.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>He did not wring his hands nor weep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor did he peek or pine,<br />
But he drank the air as though it held<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some healthful anodyne;<br />
With open mouth he drank the sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As though it had been wine!</p>
<p class="poetry">And I and all the souls in pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who tramped the other ring,<br />
Forgot if we ourselves had done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A great or little thing,<br />
And watched with gaze of dull amaze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who had to swing.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>And strange it was to see him pass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a step so light and gay,<br />
And strange it was to see him look<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So wistfully at the day,<br />
And strange it was to think that he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had such a debt to pay.</p>
<p class="poetry">For oak and elm have pleasant leaves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That in the springtime shoot:<br />
But grim to see is the gallows-tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With its adder-bitten root,<br />
And, green or dry, a man must die<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before it bears its fruit!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>The loftiest place is that seat of grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For which all worldlings try:<br />
But who would stand in hempen band<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon a scaffold high,<br />
And through a murderer&rsquo;s collar take<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His last look at the sky?</p>
<p class="poetry">It is sweet to dance to violins<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Love and Life are fair:<br />
To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is delicate and rare:<br />
But it is not sweet with nimble feet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To dance upon the air!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>So with curious eyes and sick surmise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We watched him day by day,<br />
And wondered if each one of us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would end the self-same way,<br />
For none can tell to what red Hell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His sightless soul may stray.</p>
<p class="poetry">At last the dead man walked no more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amongst the Trial Men,<br />
And I knew that he was standing up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the black dock&rsquo;s dreadful pen,<br />
And that never would I see his face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In God&rsquo;s sweet world again.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Like two doomed ships that pass in storm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We had crossed each other&rsquo;s way:<br />
But we made no sign, we said no word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We had no word to say;<br />
For we did not meet in the holy night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the shameful day.</p>
<p class="poetry">A prison wall was round us both,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two outcast men we were:<br />
The world had thrust us from its heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And God from out His care:<br />
And the iron gin that waits for Sin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had caught us in its snare.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>III</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> Debtors&rsquo;
Yard the stones are hard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the dripping wall is high,<br />
So it was there he took the air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the leaden sky,<br />
And by each side a Warder walked,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For fear the man might die.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>Or else he sat with those who watched<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His anguish night and day;<br />
Who watched him when he rose to weep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And when he crouched to pray;<br />
Who watched him lest himself should rob<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their scaffold of its prey.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Governor was strong upon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Regulations Act:<br />
The Doctor said that Death was but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A scientific fact:<br />
And twice a day the Chaplain called,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And left a little tract.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>And twice a day he smoked his pipe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And drank his quart of beer:<br />
His soul was resolute, and held<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No hiding-place for fear;<br />
He often said that he was glad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hangman&rsquo;s hands were near.</p>
<p class="poetry">But why he said so strange a thing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No Warder dared to ask:<br />
For he to whom a watcher&rsquo;s doom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is given as his task,<br />
Must set a lock upon his lips,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And make his face a mask.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Or else he might be moved, and try<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To comfort or console:<br />
And what should Human Pity do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pent up in Murderers&rsquo; Hole?<br />
What word of grace in such a place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could help a brother&rsquo;s soul?</p>
<p class="poetry">With slouch and swing around the ring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We trod the Fools&rsquo; Parade!<br />
We did not care: we knew we were<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Devil&rsquo;s Own Brigade:<br />
And shaven head and feet of lead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Make a merry masquerade.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>We tore the tarry rope to shreds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With blunt and bleeding nails;<br />
We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cleaned the shining rails:<br />
And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And clattered with the pails.</p>
<p class="poetry">We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We turned the dusty drill:<br />
We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sweated on the mill:<br />
But in the heart of every man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Terror was lying still.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>So still it lay that every day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:<br />
And we forgot the bitter lot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That waits for fool and knave,<br />
Till once, as we tramped in from work,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We passed an open grave.</p>
<p class="poetry">With yawning mouth the yellow hole<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gaped for a living thing;<br />
The very mud cried out for blood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the thirsty asphalte ring:<br />
And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some prisoner had to swing.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>Right in we went, with soul intent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Death and Dread and Doom:<br />
The hangman, with his little bag,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Went shuffling through the gloom:<br />
And each man trembled as he crept<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into his numbered tomb.</p>
<p class="poetry">That night the empty corridors<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were full of forms of Fear,<br />
And up and down the iron town<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stole feet we could not hear,<br />
And through the bars that hide the stars<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; White faces seemed to peer.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>He lay as one who lies and dreams<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a pleasant meadow-land,<br />
The watchers watched him as he slept,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And could not understand<br />
How one could sleep so sweet a sleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a hangman close at hand.</p>
<p class="poetry">But there is no sleep when men must weep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who never yet have wept:<br />
So we&mdash;the fool, the fraud, the knave&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That endless vigil kept,<br />
And through each brain on hands of pain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Another&rsquo;s terror crept.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>Alas! it is a fearful thing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To feel another&rsquo;s guilt!<br />
For, right within, the sword of Sin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pierced to its poisoned hilt,<br />
And as molten lead were the tears we shed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the blood we had not spilt.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Warders with their shoes of felt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crept by each padlocked door,<br />
And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grey figures on the floor,<br />
And wondered why men knelt to pray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who never prayed before.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>All through the night we knelt and prayed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mad mourners of a corse!<br />
The troubled plumes of midnight were<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The plumes upon a hearse:<br />
And bitter wine upon a sponge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the savour of Remorse.</p>
<p class="poetry">The grey cock crew, the red cock crew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But never came the day:<br />
And crooked shapes of Terror crouched,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the corners where we lay:<br />
And each evil sprite that walks by night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before us seemed to play.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>They glided past, they glided fast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like travellers through a mist:<br />
They mocked the moon in a rigadoon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of delicate turn and twist,<br />
And with formal pace and loathsome grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The phantoms kept their tryst.</p>
<p class="poetry">With mop and mow, we saw them go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Slim shadows hand in hand:<br />
About, about, in ghostly rout<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They trod a saraband:<br />
And the damned grotesques made arabesques,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the wind upon the sand!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>With the pirouettes of marionettes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They tripped on pointed tread:<br />
But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As their grisly masque they led,<br />
And loud they sang, and long they sang,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For they sang to wake the dead.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Oho!&rsquo; they cried, &lsquo;The world
is wide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But fettered limbs go lame!<br />
And once, or twice, to throw the dice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is a gentlemanly game,<br />
But he does not win who plays with Sin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the secret House of Shame.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>No things of air these antics were,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That frolicked with such glee:<br />
To men whose lives were held in gyves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And whose feet might not go free,<br />
Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most terrible to see.</p>
<p class="poetry">Around, around, they waltzed and wound;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some wheeled in smirking pairs;<br />
With the mincing step of a demirep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some sidled up the stairs:<br />
And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each helped us at our prayers.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>The morning wind began to moan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But still the night went on:<br />
Through its giant loom the web of gloom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crept till each thread was spun:<br />
And, as we prayed, we grew afraid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the Justice of the Sun.</p>
<p class="poetry">The moaning wind went wandering round<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The weeping prison-wall:<br />
Till like a wheel of turning steel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We felt the minutes crawl:<br />
O moaning wind! what had we done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To have such a seneschal?</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>At last I saw the shadowed bars,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a lattice wrought in lead,<br />
Move right across the whitewashed wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That faced my three-plank bed,<br />
And I knew that somewhere in the world<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God&rsquo;s dreadful dawn was red.</p>
<p class="poetry">At six o&rsquo;clock we cleaned our cells,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; At seven all was still,<br />
But the sough and swing of a mighty wing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The prison seemed to fill,<br />
For the Lord of Death with icy breath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had entered in to kill.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>He did not pass in purple pomp,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor ride a moon-white steed.<br />
Three yards of cord and a sliding board<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are all the gallows&rsquo; need:<br />
So with rope of shame the Herald came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To do the secret deed.</p>
<p class="poetry">We were as men who through a fen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of filthy darkness grope:<br />
We did not dare to breathe a prayer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or to give our anguish scope:<br />
Something was dead in each of us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And what was dead was Hope.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>For Man&rsquo;s grim Justice goes its way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And will not swerve aside:<br />
It slays the weak, it slays the strong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It has a deadly stride:<br />
With iron heel it slays the strong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The monstrous parricide!</p>
<p class="poetry">We waited for the stroke of eight:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each tongue was thick with thirst:<br />
For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That makes a man accursed,<br />
And Fate will use a running noose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the best man and the worst.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>We had no other thing to do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save to wait for the sign to come:<br />
So, like things of stone in a valley lone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quiet we sat and dumb:<br />
But each man&rsquo;s heart beat thick and quick,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a madman on a drum!</p>
<p class="poetry">With sudden shock the prison-clock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Smote on the shivering air,<br />
And from all the gaol rose up a wail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of impotent despair,<br />
Like the sound that frightened marshes hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From some leper in his lair.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>And as one sees most fearful things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the crystal of a dream,<br />
We saw the greasy hempen rope<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hooked to the blackened beam,<br />
And heard the prayer the hangman&rsquo;s snare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strangled into a scream.</p>
<p class="poetry">And all the woe that moved him so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he gave that bitter cry,<br />
And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; None knew so well as I:<br />
For he who lives more lives than one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More deaths than one must die.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page36"></a><span

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> is no chapel
on the day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On which they hang a man:<br />
The Chaplain&rsquo;s heart is far too sick,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or his face is far too wan,<br />
Or there is that written in his eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which none should look upon.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>So they kept us close till nigh on noon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then they rang the bell,<br />
And the Warders with their jingling keys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Opened each listening cell,<br />
And down the iron stair we tramped,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each from his separate Hell.</p>
<p class="poetry">Out into God&rsquo;s sweet air we went,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But not in wonted way,<br />
For this man&rsquo;s face was white with fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that man&rsquo;s face was grey,<br />
And I never saw sad men who looked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So wistfully at the day.</p>

38</span>I never saw sad men who looked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With such a wistful eye<br />
Upon that little tent of blue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We prisoners called the sky,<br />
And at every careless cloud that passed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In happy freedom by.</p>
<p class="poetry">But there were those amongst us all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who walked with downcast head,<br />
And knew that, had each got his due,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They should have died instead:<br />
He had but killed a thing that lived,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst they had killed the dead.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>For he who sins a second time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wakes a dead soul to pain,<br />
And draws it from its spotted shroud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And makes it bleed again,<br />
And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And makes it bleed in vain!</p>
<p class="poetry">Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With crooked arrows starred,<br />
Silently we went round and round<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The slippery asphalte yard;<br />
Silently we went round and round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And no man spoke a word.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>Silently we went round and round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And through each hollow mind<br />
The Memory of dreadful things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rushed like a dreadful wind,<br />
And Horror stalked before each man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Terror crept behind.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Warders strutted up and down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And kept their herd of brutes,<br />
Their uniforms were spick and span,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they wore their Sunday suits,<br />
But we knew the work they had been at,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the quicklime on their boots.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>For where a grave had opened wide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no grave at all:<br />
Only a stretch of mud and sand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the hideous prison-wall,<br />
And a little heap of burning lime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the man should have his pall.</p>
<p class="poetry">For he has a pall, this wretched man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such as few men can claim:<br />
Deep down below a prison-yard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Naked for greater shame,<br />
He lies, with fetters on each foot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrapt in a sheet of flame!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>And all the while the burning lime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Eats flesh and bone away,<br />
It eats the brittle bone by night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the soft flesh by day,<br />
It eats the flesh and bone by turns,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But it eats the heart alway.</p>
<p class="poetry">For three long years they will not sow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or root or seedling there:<br />
For three long years the unblessed spot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will sterile be and bare,<br />
And look upon the wondering sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With unreproachful stare.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>They think a murderer&rsquo;s heart would taint<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each simple seed they sow.<br />
It is not true!&nbsp; God&rsquo;s kindly earth<br />

And the red rose would but blow more red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The white rose whiter blow.</p>
<p class="poetry">Out of his mouth a red, red rose!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of his heart a white!<br />
For who can say by what strange way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ brings His will to light,<br />
Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bloomed in the great Pope&rsquo;s sight?</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>But neither milk-white rose nor red<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May bloom in prison-air;<br />
The shard, the pebble, and the flint,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are what they give us there:<br />
For flowers have been known to heal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A common man&rsquo;s despair.</p>
<p class="poetry">So never will wine-red rose or white,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Petal by petal, fall<br />
On that stretch of mud and sand that lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the hideous prison-wall,<br />
To tell the men who tramp the yard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That God&rsquo;s Son died for all.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>Yet though the hideous prison-wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still hems him round and round,<br />
And a spirit may not walk by night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That is with fetters bound,<br />
And a spirit may but weep that lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In such unholy ground,</p>
<p class="poetry">He is at peace&mdash;this wretched
man&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At peace, or will be soon:<br />
There is no thing to make him mad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor does Terror walk at noon,<br />
For the lampless Earth in which he lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has neither Sun nor Moon.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>They hanged him as a beast is hanged:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They did not even toll<br />
A requiem that might have brought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rest to his startled soul,<br />
But hurriedly they took him out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hid him in a hole.</p>
<p class="poetry">They stripped him of his canvas clothes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave him to the flies:<br />
They mocked the swollen purple throat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the stark and staring eyes:<br />
And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In which their convict lies.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>The Chaplain would not kneel to pray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By his dishonoured grave:<br />
Nor mark it with that blessed Cross<br />

Because the man was one of those<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom Christ came down to save.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet all is well; he has but passed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Life&rsquo;s appointed bourne:<br />
And alien tears will fill for him<br />

<p class="poetry">Each narrow cell in which we dwell<br />

And the crimson stain that was of Cain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Became Christ&rsquo;s snow-white seal.</p>

61</span>THE BALLAD OF READING GAOL</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">A VERSION BASED ON THE ORIGINAL
DRAFT OF THE POEM</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page63"></a><span

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">He</span> did not wear his
scarlet coat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For blood and wine are red,<br />
And blood and wine were on his hands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When they found him with the dead,<br />
The poor dead woman whom he loved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And murdered in her bed.</p>
<p class="poetry">He walked amongst the Trial Men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a suit of shabby grey;<br />
A cricket cap was on his head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his step seemed light and gay;<br />
But I never saw a man who looked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So wistfully at the day.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>I never saw a man who looked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With such a wistful eye<br />
Upon that little tent of blue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which prisoners call the sky,<br />
And at every drifting cloud that went<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With sails of silver by.</p>
<p class="poetry">I walked, with other souls in pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within another ring,<br />
And was wondering if the man had done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A great or little thing,<br />
When a voice behind me whispered low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>That fellow&rsquo;s got to
swing</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Dear Christ! the very prison walls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly seemed to reel,<br />
And the sky above my head became<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a casque of scorching steel;<br />
And, though I was a soul in pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My pain I could not feel.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>I only knew what hunted thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickened his step, and why<br />
He looked upon the garish day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With such a wistful eye;<br />
The man had killed the thing he loved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so he had to die.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet each man kills the thing he loves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By each let this be heard,<br />
Some do it with a bitter look,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some with a flattering word,<br />
The coward does it with a kiss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The brave man with a sword!</p>
<p class="poetry">Some kill their love when they are young,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And some when they are old;<br />
Some strangle with the hands of Lust,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some with the hands of Gold:<br />
The kindest use a knife, because<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dead so soon grow cold.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>Some love too little, some too long,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some sell, and others buy;<br />
Some do the deed with many tears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And some without a sigh:<br />
For each man kills the thing he loves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet each man does not die.</p>
<p class="poetry">He does not die a death of shame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On a day of dark disgrace,<br />
Nor have a noose about his neck,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor a cloth upon his face,<br />
Nor drop feet foremost through the floor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into an empty space.</p>
<p class="poetry">He does not wake at dawn to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dread figures throng his room,<br />
The shivering Chaplain robed in white,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sheriff stern with gloom,<br />
And the Governor all in shiny black,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the yellow face of Doom.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>He does not rise in piteous haste<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To put on convict-clothes,<br />
While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each new and nerve-twitched pose,<br />
Fingering a watch whose little ticks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are like horrible hammer-blows.</p>
<p class="poetry">He does not know that sickening thirst<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That sands one&rsquo;s throat, before<br />
The hangman with his gardener&rsquo;s gloves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Slips through the padded door,<br />
And binds one with three leathern thongs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the throat may thirst no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">He does not bend his head to hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Burial Office read,<br />
Nor, while the terror of his soul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tells him he is not dead,<br />
Cross his own coffin, as he moves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the hideous shed.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>He does not stare upon the air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through a little roof of glass:<br />
He does not pray with lips of clay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For his agony to pass;<br />
Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The kiss of Caiaphas.</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Six</span> weeks our
guardsman walked the yard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the suit of shabby grey:<br />
His cricket cap was on his head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his step seemed light and gay,<br />
But I never saw a man who looked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So wistfully at the day.</p>
<p class="poetry">He did not wring his hands nor weep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor did he peek or pine,<br />
But he drank the air as though it held<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some healthful anodyne;<br />
With open mouth he drank the sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As though it had been wine!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>And I and all the souls in pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who tramped the other ring,<br />
Forgot if we ourselves had done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A great or little thing,<br />
And watched with gaze of dull amaze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who had to swing.</p>
<p class="poetry">So with curious eyes and sick surmise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We watched him day by day,<br />
And wondered if each one of us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would end the self-same way,<br />
For none can tell to what red Hell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His sightless soul may stray.</p>
<p class="poetry">At last the dead man walked no more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amongst the Trial Men,<br />
And I knew that he was standing up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the black dock&rsquo;s dreadful pen,<br />
And that never would I see his face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In God&rsquo;s sweet world again.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>Like two doomed ships that pass in storm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We had crossed each other&rsquo;s way:<br />
But we made no sign, we said no word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We had no word to say;<br />
For we did not meet in the holy night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the shameful day.</p>
<p class="poetry">A prison wall was round us both,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two outcast men we were:<br />
The world had thrust us from its heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And God from out His care:<br />
And the iron gin that waits for Sin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had caught us in its snare.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>III</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> Debtors&rsquo;
Yard the stones are hard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the dripping wall is high,<br />
So it was there he took the air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the leaden sky,<br />
And by each side a Warder walked,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For fear the man might die.</p>
<p class="poetry">Or else he sat with those who watched<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His anguish night and day;<br />
Who watched him when he rose to weep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And when he crouched to pray;<br />
Who watched him lest himself should rob<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their scaffold of its prey.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>And twice a day he smoked his pipe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And drank his quart of beer:<br />
His soul was resolute, and held<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No hiding-place for fear;<br />
He often said that he was glad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hangman&rsquo;s hands were near.</p>
<p class="poetry">But why he said so strange a thing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No Warder dared to ask:<br />
For he to whom a watcher&rsquo;s doom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is given as his task,<br />
Must set a lock upon his lips,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And make his face a mask.</p>
<p class="poetry">With slouch and swing around the ring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We trod the Fools&rsquo; Parade!<br />
We did not care: we knew we were<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Devil&rsquo;s Own Brigade:<br />
And shaven head and feet of lead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Make a merry masquerade.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>We tore the tarry rope to shreds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With blunt and bleeding nails;<br />
We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cleaned the shining rails:<br />
And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And clattered with the pails.</p>
<p class="poetry">We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We turned the dusty drill:<br />
We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sweated on the mill:<br />
But in the heart of every man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Terror was lying still.</p>
<p class="poetry">So still it lay that every day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:<br />
And we forgot the bitter lot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That waits for fool and knave,<br />
Till once, as we tramped in from work,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We passed an open grave.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>Right in we went, with soul intent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Death and Dread and Doom:<br />
The hangman, with his little bag,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Went shuffling through the gloom:<br />
And each man trembled as he crept<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into his numbered tomb.</p>
<p class="poetry">That night the empty corridors<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were full of forms of Fear,<br />
And up and down the iron town<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stole feet we could not hear,<br />
And through the bars that hide the stars<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; White faces seemed to peer.</p>
<p class="poetry">But there is no sleep when men must weep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who never yet have wept:<br />
So we&mdash;the fool, the fraud, the knave&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That endless vigil kept,<br />
And through each brain on hands of pain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Another&rsquo;s terror crept.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>Alas! it is a fearful thing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To feel another&rsquo;s guilt!<br />
For, right within, the sword of Sin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pierced to its poisoned hilt,<br />
And as molten lead were the tears we shed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the blood we had not spilt.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Warders with their shoes of felt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crept by each padlocked door,<br />
And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grey figures on the floor,<br />
And wondered why men knelt to pray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who never prayed before.</p>
<p class="poetry">The morning wind began to moan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But still the night went on:<br />
Through its giant loom the web of gloom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crept till each thread was spun:<br />
And, as we prayed, we grew afraid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the Justice of the Sun.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>At last I saw the shadowed bars,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a lattice wrought in lead,<br />
Move right across the whitewashed wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That faced my three-plank bed,<br />
And I knew that somewhere in the world<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God&rsquo;s dreadful dawn was red.</p>
<p class="poetry">At six o&rsquo;clock we cleaned our cells,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; At seven all was still,<br />
But the sough and swing of a mighty wing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The prison seemed to fill,<br />
For the Lord of Death with icy breath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had entered in to kill.</p>
<p class="poetry">He did not pass in purple pomp,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor ride a moon-white steed.<br />
Three yards of cord and a sliding board<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are all the gallows&rsquo; need:<br />
So with rope of shame the Herald came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To do the secret deed.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>We waited for the stroke of eight:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each tongue was thick with thirst:<br />
For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That makes a man accursed,<br />
And Fate will use a running noose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the best man and the worst.</p>
<p class="poetry">We had no other thing to do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save to wait for the sign to come:<br />
So, like things of stone in a valley lone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quiet we sat and dumb:<br />
But each man&rsquo;s heart beat thick and quick,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a madman on a drum!</p>
<p class="poetry">With sudden shock the prison-clock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Smote on the shivering air,<br />
And from all the gaol rose up a wail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of impotent despair,<br />
Like the sound that frightened marshes hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From some leper in his lair.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>And as one sees most fearful things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the crystal of a dream,<br />
We saw the greasy hempen rope<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hooked to the blackened beam,<br />
And heard the prayer the hangman&rsquo;s snare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strangled into a scream.</p>
<p class="poetry">And all the woe that moved him so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he gave that bitter cry,<br />
And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; None knew so well as I:<br />
For he who lives more lives than one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More deaths than one must die.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>IV</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> is no chapel
on the day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On which they hang a man:<br />
The Chaplain&rsquo;s heart is far too sick,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or his face is far too wan,<br />
Or there is that written in his eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which none should look upon.</p>
<p class="poetry">So they kept us close till nigh on noon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then they rang the bell,<br />
And the Warders with their jingling keys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Opened each listening cell,<br />
And down the iron stair we tramped,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each from his separate Hell.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>Out into God&rsquo;s sweet air we went,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But not in wonted way,<br />
For this man&rsquo;s face was white with fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that man&rsquo;s face was grey,<br />
And I never saw sad men who looked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So wistfully at the day.</p>
<p class="poetry">I never saw sad men who looked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With such a wistful eye<br />
Upon that little tent of blue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We prisoners called the sky,<br />
And at every careless cloud that passed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In happy freedom by.</p>
<p class="poetry">But there were those amongst us all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who walked with downcast head,<br />
And knew that, had each got his due,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They should have died instead:<br />
He had but killed a thing that lived,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst they had killed the dead.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>For he who sins a second time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wakes a dead soul to pain,<br />
And draws it from its spotted shroud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And makes it bleed again,<br />
And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And makes it bleed in vain!</p>
<p class="poetry">Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With crooked arrows starred,<br />
Silently we went round and round<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The slippery asphalte yard;<br />
Silently we went round and round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And no man spoke a word.</p>
<p class="poetry">Silently we went round and round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And through each hollow mind<br />
The Memory of dreadful things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rushed like a dreadful wind,<br />
And Horror stalked before each man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Terror crept behind.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>The Warders strutted up and down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And kept their herd of brutes,<br />
Their uniforms were spick and span,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they wore their Sunday suits,<br />
But we knew the work they had been at,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the quicklime on their boots.</p>
<p class="poetry">For where a grave had opened wide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no grave at all:<br />
Only a stretch of mud and sand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the hideous prison-wall,<br />
And a little heap of burning lime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the man should have his pall.</p>
<p class="poetry">For he has a pall, this wretched man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such as few men can claim:<br />
Deep down below a prison-yard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Naked for greater shame,<br />
He lies, with fetters on each foot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrapt in a sheet of flame!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>For three long years they will not sow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or root or seedling there:<br />
For three long years the unblessed spot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will sterile be and bare,<br />
And look upon the wondering sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With unreproachful stare.</p>
<p class="poetry">They think a murderer&rsquo;s heart would
taint<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each simple seed they sow.<br />
It is not true!&nbsp; God&rsquo;s kindly earth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is kindlier than men know,<br />
And the red rose would but blow more red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The white rose whiter blow.</p>
<p class="poetry">Out of his mouth a red, red rose!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of his heart a white!<br />
For who can say by what strange way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ brings His will to light,<br />
Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bloomed in the great Pope&rsquo;s sight?</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>But neither milk-white rose nor red<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May bloom in prison-air;<br />
The shard, the pebble, and the flint,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are what they give us there:<br />
For flowers have been known to heal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A common man&rsquo;s despair.</p>
<p class="poetry">So never will wine-red rose or white,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Petal by petal, fall<br />
On that stretch of mud and sand that lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the hideous prison-wall,<br />
To tell the men who tramp the yard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That God&rsquo;s Son died for all.</p>
<p class="poetry">He is at peace&mdash;this wretched
man&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At peace, or will be soon:<br />
There is no thing to make him mad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor does Terror walk at noon,<br />
For the lampless Earth in which he lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has neither Sun nor Moon.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>The Chaplain would not kneel to pray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By his dishonoured grave:<br />
Nor mark it with that blessed Cross<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That Christ for sinners gave,<br />
Because the man was one of those<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom Christ came down to save.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet all is well; he has but passed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Life&rsquo;s appointed bourne:<br />
And alien tears will fill for him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pity&rsquo;s long-broken urn,<br />
For his mourners will be outcast men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And outcasts always mourn.</p>

137</span>To light thine altar; He <a name="citation137"></a><a
href="#footnote137" class="citation">[137]</a> too loves thee
well,<br />
Who saw old Merlin lured in Vivien&rsquo;s snare,<br />
And the white feet of angels coming down the golden stair,</p>
<p class="poetry">Loves thee so well, that all the World for
him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A gorgeous-coloured vestiture must wear,<br />
And Sorrow take a purple diadem,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or else be no more Sorrow, and Despair<br />
Gild its own thorns, and Pain, like Adon, be<br />
Even in anguish beautiful;&mdash;such is the empery</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>Which Painters hold, and such the heritage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This gentle solemn Spirit doth possess,<br />
Being a better mirror of his age<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In all his pity, love, and weariness,<br />
Than those who can but copy common things,<br />
And leave the Soul unpainted with its mighty questionings.</p>
<p class="poetry">But they are few, and all romance has flown,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And men can prophesy about the sun,<br />
And lecture on his arrows&mdash;how, alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through a waste void the soulless atoms run,<br />
<a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>How from
each tree its weeping nymph has fled,<br />
And that no more &rsquo;mid English reeds a Naiad shows her
head.</p>
<h2><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>THE
HARLOT&rsquo;S HOUSE</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">We</span> caught the tread
of dancing feet,<br />
We loitered down the moonlit street,<br />
And stopped beneath the harlot&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p class="poetry">Inside, above the din and fray,<br />
We heard the loud musicians play<br />
The &lsquo;Treues Liebes Herz&rsquo; of Strauss.</p>
<p class="poetry">Like strange mechanical grotesques,<br />
Making fantastic arabesques,<br />
The shadows raced across the blind.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>We watched the ghostly dancers spin<br />
To sound of horn and violin,<br />
Like black leaves wheeling in the wind.</p>
<p class="poetry">Like wire-pulled automatons,<br />
Slim silhouetted skeletons<br />
Went sidling through the slow quadrille,</p>
<p class="poetry">Then took each other by the hand,<br />
And danced a stately saraband;<br />
Their laughter echoed thin and shrill.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sometimes a clockwork puppet pressed<br />
A phantom lover to her breast,<br />
Sometimes they seemed to try to sing.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>Sometimes a horrible marionette<br />
Came out, and smoked its cigarette<br />
Upon the steps like a live thing.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then, turning to my love, I said,<br />
&lsquo;The dead are dancing with the dead,<br />
The dust is whirling with the dust.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">But she&mdash;she heard the violin,<br />
And left my side, and entered in:<br />
Love passed into the house of lust.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then suddenly the tune went false,<br />
The dancers wearied of the waltz,<br />
The shadows ceased to wheel and whirl.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>And down the long and silent street,<br />
The dawn, with silver-sandalled feet,<br />
Crept like a frightened girl.</p>
<h2><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>FROM
&lsquo;THE BURDEN OF ITYS&rsquo;</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">This</span> English Thames
is holier far than Rome,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those harebells like a sudden flush of sea<br />
Breaking across the woodland, with the foam<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of meadow-sweet and white anemone<br />
To fleck their blue waves,&mdash;God is likelier there<br />
Than hidden in that crystal-hearted star the pale monks bear!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>Those violet-gleaming butterflies that take<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yon creamy lily for their pavilion<br />
Are monsignores, and where the rushes shake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A lazy pike lies basking in the sun,<br />
His eyes half shut,&mdash;he is some mitred old<br />
Bishop in <i>partibus</i>! look at those gaudy scales all green
and gold.</p>
<p class="poetry">The wind the restless prisoner of the trees<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Does well for Pal&aelig;strina, one would say<br />
The mighty master&rsquo;s hands were on the keys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the Maria organ, which they play<br />
<a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>When
early on some sapphire Easter morn<br />
In a high litter red as blood or sin the Pope is borne</p>
<p class="poetry">From his dark House out to the Balcony<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the bronze gates and the crowded square,<br />
Whose very fountains seem for ecstasy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To toss their silver lances in the air,<br />
And stretching out weak hands to East and West<br />
In vain sends peace to peaceless lands, to restless nations
rest.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>Is not yon lingering orange after-glow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That stays to vex the moon more fair than all<br />
Rome&rsquo;s lordliest pageants! strange, a year ago<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I knelt before some crimson Cardinal<br />
Who bare the Host across the Esquiline,<br />
And now&mdash;those common poppies in the wheat seem twice as
fine.</p>
<p class="poetry">The blue-green beanfields yonder, tremulous<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the last shower, sweeter perfume bring<br />
<a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>Through
this cool evening than the odorous<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flame-jewelled censers the young deacons swing,<br
/>
When the grey priest unlocks the curtained shrine,<br />
And makes God&rsquo;s body from the common fruit of corn and
vine.</p>
<p class="poetry">Poor Fra Giovanni bawling at the Mass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were out of tune now, for a small brown bird<br />
Sings overhead, and through the long cool grass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I see that throbbing throat which once I heard<br />
<a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>On
starlit hills of flower-starred Arcady,<br />
Once where the white and crescent sand of Salamis meets sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sweet is the swallow twittering on the eaves<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; At daybreak, when the mower whets his scythe,<br />
And stock-doves murmur, and the milkmaid leaves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her little lonely bed, and carols blithe<br />
To see the heavy-lowing cattle wait<br />
Stretching their huge and dripping mouths across the farmyard
gate.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>And sweet the hops upon the Kentish leas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sweet the wind that lifts the new-mown hay,<br
/>
And sweet the fretful swarms of grumbling bees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That round and round the linden blossoms play;<br />
And sweet the heifer breathing in the stall,<br />
And the green bursting figs that hang upon the red-brick
wall,</p>
<p class="poetry">And sweet to hear the cuckoo mock the spring<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; While the last violet loiters by the well,<br />
<a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>And
sweet to hear the shepherd Daphnis sing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The song of Linus through a sunny dell<br />
Of warm Arcadia where the corn is gold<br />
And the slight lithe-limbed reapers dance about the wattled
fold.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p class="poetry">It was a dream, the glade is tenantless,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No soft Ionian laughter moves the air,<br />
The Thames creeps on in sluggish leadenness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And from the copse left desolate and bare<br />
Fled is young Bacchus with his revelry,<br />
Yet still from Nuneham wood there comes that thrilling melody</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>So sad, that one might think a human heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brake in each separate note, a quality<br />
Which music sometimes has, being the Art<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is most nigh to tears and memory;<br />
Poor mourning Philomel, what dost thou fear?<br />
Thy sister doth not haunt these fields, Pandion is not here,</p>
<p class="poetry">Here is no cruel Lord with murderous blade,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; No woven web of bloody heraldries,<br />
But mossy dells for roving comrades made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Warm valleys where the tired student lies<br />
<a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>With
half-shut book, and many a winding walk<br />
Where rustic lovers stray at eve in happy simple talk.</p>
<p class="poetry">The harmless rabbit gambols with its young<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the trampled towing-path, where late<br />
A troop of laughing boys in jostling throng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheered with their noisy cries the racing eight;<br
/>
The gossamer, with ravelled silver threads,<br />
Works at its little loom, and from the dusky red-eaved sheds</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>Of the lone Farm a flickering light shines out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the swinked shepherd drives his bleating
flock<br />
Back to their wattled sheep-cotes, a faint shout<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes from some Oxford boat at Sandford lock,<br />
And starts the moor-hen from the sedgy rill,<br />
And the dim lengthening shadows flit like swallows up the
hill.</p>
<p class="poetry">The heron passes homeward to the mere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The blue mist creeps among the shivering trees,<br
/>
<a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>Gold
world by world the silent stars appear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And like a blossom blown before the breeze<br />
A white moon drifts across the shimmering sky,<br />
Mute arbitress of all thy sad, thy rapturous threnody.</p>
<p class="poetry">She does not heed thee, wherefore should she
heed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She knows Endymion is not far away;<br />
&rsquo;Tis I, &rsquo;tis I, whose soul is as the reed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which has no message of its own to play,<br />
<a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>So pipes
another&rsquo;s bidding, it is I,<br />
Drifting with every wind on the wide sea of misery.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah! the brown bird has ceased: one exquisite
trill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; About the sombre woodland seems to cling<br />
Dying in music, else the air is still,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So still that one might hear the bat&rsquo;s small
wing<br />
Wander and wheel above the pines, or tell<br />
Each tiny dew-drop dripping from the bluebell&rsquo;s brimming
cell.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>And far away across the lengthening wold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the willowy flats and thickets brown,<br />
Magdalen&rsquo;s tall tower tipped with tremulous gold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Marks the long High Street of the little town,<br />
And warns me to return; I must not wait,<br />
Hark! &rsquo;t is the curfew booming from the bell at Christ
Church gate.</p>

158</span>FLOWER OF LOVE</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Sweet</span>, I blame you
not, for mine the fault<br />
was, had I not been made of common clay<br />
I had climbed the higher heights unclimbed<br />
yet, seen the fuller air, the larger day.</p>
<p class="poetry">From the wildness of my wasted passion I had<br
/>
struck a better, clearer song,<br />
Lit some lighter light of freer freedom, battled<br />
with some Hydra-headed wrong.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>Had my lips been smitten into music by the<br />
kisses that but made them bleed,<br />
You had walked with Bice and the angels on<br />
that verdant and enamelled mead.</p>
<p class="poetry">I had trod the road which Dante treading saw<br
/>
the suns of seven circles shine,<br />
Ay! perchance had seen the heavens opening,<br />
as they opened to the Florentine.</p>
<p class="poetry">And the mighty nations would have crowned<br />
me, who am crownless now and without name,<br />
<a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>And some
orient dawn had found me kneeling<br />
on the threshold of the House of Fame.</p>
<p class="poetry">I had sat within that marble circle where
the<br />
oldest bard is as the young,<br />
And the pipe is ever dropping honey, and the<br />
lyre&rsquo;s strings are ever strung.</p>
<p class="poetry">Keats had lifted up his hymeneal curls from
out<br />
the poppy-seeded wine,<br />
With ambrosial mouth had kissed my forehead,<br />
clasped the hand of noble love in mine.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>And at springtide, when the apple-blossoms<br />
brush the burnished bosom of the dove,<br />
Two young lovers lying in an orchard would<br />
have read the story of our love;</p>
<p class="poetry">Would have read the legend of my passion,<br />
known the bitter secret of my heart,<br />
Kissed as we have kissed, but never parted as<br />
we two are fated now to part.</p>
<p class="poetry">For the crimson flower of our life is eaten
by<br />
the cankerworm of truth,<br />
And no hand can gather up the fallen withered<br />
petals of the rose of youth.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>Yet I am not sorry that I loved you&mdash;ah!<br />
what else had I a boy to do,&mdash;<br />
For the hungry teeth of time devour, and the<br />
silent-footed years pursue.</p>
<p class="poetry">Rudderless, we drift athwart a tempest, and<br
/>
when once the storm of youth is past,<br />
Without lyre, without lute or chorus, Death<br />
the silent pilot comes at last.</p>
<p class="poetry">And within the grave there is no pleasure,<br
/>
for the blindworm battens on the root,<br />
And Desire shudders into ashes, and the tree<br />
of Passion bears no fruit.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>Ah! what else had I to do but love you?<br />
God&rsquo;s own mother was less dear to me,<br />
And less dear the Cyther&aelig;an rising like an<br />
argent lily from the sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">I have made my choice, have lived my<br />
poems, and, though youth is gone in wasted days,<br />
I have found the lover&rsquo;s crown of myrtle better<br />
than the poet&rsquo;s crown of bays.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
